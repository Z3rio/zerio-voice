# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide will give you an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, please look through our [read me](./README.md) as that contains information about our project structure and such.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you are encountering a problem with our voice system, first check if an issue for it already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Z3rio/zerio-voice/issues/new/choose).

#### Solving an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Z3rio/zerio-voice/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you can open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "[Self-review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist) to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill out the template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles: .
